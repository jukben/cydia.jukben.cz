# GlitchMe

With this tweak you can easily turn your lock background into glitching monster. Feel like a true hacker, or bamboozle your grandma, it's upon to you.

Place your wallpaper to _var/mobile/Library/LockHTML/GlitchMe/wallpaper.jpeg_

Be aware of proper aspect ratio which is configurable in settings (in XenHTML).
